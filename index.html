		<h1>STANDARD TERMS OF BUSINESS (effective August 2025)</h1>
		<p>The following terms of business apply to all engagements accepted by Cedar Bloom
			Accounting. All work is carried out under these terms except where changes are expressly agreed in
			writing.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Applicable law
				<ol>
					<li>Our engagement letter, the
						schedules of services and our standard terms and conditions of business are governed by and should be
						construed
						in
						accordance with, English law. Each party agrees that the courts of England will have exclusive jurisdiction in
						relation to any claim, dispute or difference concerning this engagement letter and any matter arising from it
						on
						any basis. Each party irrevocably waives any right to object to any action being brought in those courts, to
						claim
						that the action has been brought in an inappropriate forum, or to claim that those courts do not have
						jurisdiction.</li>

					<li>We will not accept
						responsibility if you act on advice previously given by us without first confirming with us that the advice is
						still valid in light of any change in the law or in your circumstances. We will accept no liability for losses
						arising from changes in the law, or the interpretation thereof, that occur after the date on which the advice
						is
						given.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Client identification
				<ol>
					<li>As with other professional services firms, we are required to
						identify our clients for the purposes of the UK anti-money laundering legislation. We may request from you,
						and
						retain, such information and documentation as we require for these purposes and/or make searches of
						appropriate
						databases. If we are not able to obtain satisfactory evidence of your identity, we will not be able to proceed
						with the engagement.</li>
					<li>If you undertake business that requires you to be supervised by
						an
						appropriate supervisory authority to follow anti-money laundering regulations including if you accept or make
						a
						high value cash payments of &euro;10,000 or more (or equivalent in any currency) in exchange for goods you
						should inform us.</li>
					<li>Any personal data received from you to comply with our
						obligations
						under The Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer for Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations
						2017 (MLR 2017) will be processed only for the purposes of preventing money laundering or terrorist financing.
						No other use will be made of this personal data unless use of the data is permitted by or under enactment
						other
						than the MLR 2017, or we have obtained the consent of the data subject to the proposed use of the data.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Commissions or other benefits
				<ol>
					<li>In some circumstances, we may receive commissions or other
						benefits
						for introductions to other professionals or in respect of transactions which we arrange for you. </li>
					<li>If this happens, we will notify you in writingof the amount and terms of payment and receipt of any such
						commissions or benefits. The same will apply if the payment is made to, or the transactions are arranged by
						one
						of our associates. The fees you would otherwise pay will not be reduced by the amount of the commissions or
						benefits. You agree that we or our associates, can retain the commission or other benefits without being
						liable
						to account to you for any such amounts. </li>
					<li>If in the future, abnormally large commissions (for example more
						than double the largest amount in 4.3) are received which were not envisaged when the engagement letter was
						signed, we will obtain specific consent to the retention of those commissions.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Confidentiality</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Unless we are authorised by you to disclose information on your
					behalf,
					we confirm that if you give us confidential information we will, at all times during and after this
					engagement,
					keep it confidential, except as required by law or as provided for in regulatory, ethical or other
					professional
					pronouncements applicable to us or our engagement. </li>
				<li>You agree that, if we act for other clients who are or who become your
					competitors, to comply with our duty of confidentiality it will be sufficient for us to take such steps as we
					think appropriate to preserve the confidentiality of information given to us by you, both during and after
					this
					engagement. These may include taking the same or similar steps as we take in respect of the confidentiality of
					our own information.</li>
				<li>In addition, if we act for other clients whose interests are or may be
					adverse to yours, we will manage the conflict by implementing additional safeguards to preserve
					confidentiality.
					Safeguards may include measures such as separate teams, physical separation of teams, and separate
					arrangements
					for storage of, and access to, information. </li>
				<li>You agree that the effective implementation of such steps or
					safeguards
					as described above will provide adequate measures to avoid any real risk of confidentiality being
					impaired.</li>
				<li>We may, on occasion, subcontract work on your affairs to other tax or
					accounting professionals. The subcontractors will be bound by our client confidentiality terms. </li>
				<li>We will inform you of the proposed use of a subcontractor before they
					commence work, except where your data will not be transferred out of our systems and the subcontractor is
					bound
					by confidentiality terms equivalent to an employee.</li>
				<li>If we use external or cloud-based systems, we will ensure
					confidentiality of your information is maintained.</li>
				<li>This applies in addition to our obligations on data protection in
					section [6]</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Conflicts of interest</li>
			<ol>
				<li>We will inform you if we
					become
					aware of any conflict of interest in our relationship with you or in our relationship with you and another
					client,
					unless we are unable to do so because of our confidentiality obligations. We have safeguards that can be
					implemented to protect the interests of different clients if a conflict arises. If conflicts are identified
					which
					cannot be managed in a way that protects your interests, we regret that we will be unable to provide further
					services.</li>

				<li>If there is a conflict of
					interest that is capable of being addressed successfully by the adoption of suitable safeguards to protect
					your
					interests, we will adopt those safeguards. In resolving the conflict, we would be guided by ICAEW&rsquo;s Code
					of
					Ethics, which can be viewed at <a
						href="https://www.icaew.com/en/membership/regulations-standards-and-guidance/ethics">icaew.com/en/membership/regulations-standards-and-guidance/ethics</a>.
					During and after our engagement, you agree that we reserve the right to act for other clients whose
					interests are or may compete with, or be adverse to, yours subject, of course, to our obligations of
					confidentiality and the safeguards set out in the paragraph on confidentiality above.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Data Protection</li>
			<ol>
				<li>In this clause [6], the following definitions
					shall
					apply:&lsquo;client personal data&rsquo; means any personal data provided to us by you, or on your behalf,
					for the purpose of providing our services to you, pursuant to our engagement letter with you;&lsquo;data
					protection legislation&rsquo; means all applicable privacy and data protection legislation and regulations
					including PECR, the UK GDPR and any other applicable national laws, regulations and secondary legislation in
					the
					UK relating to the processing of personal data and the privacy of electronic communications, as amended,
					replaced or updated from time to time;&lsquo;controller&rsquo;, &lsquo;data subject&rsquo;,
					&lsquo;personal
					data&rsquo;, and &lsquo;process&rsquo; shall have the meanings given to them in the data protection
					legislation;
					&lsquo;UK GDPR&rsquo; means the Data Protection Act 2018 as amended by the Data Protection, Privacy and
					Electronic Communications (Amendments etc) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020; and&lsquo;PECR&rsquo; means the
					Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (SI 2426/2003) as amended by the Data
					Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendments etc) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020.
				</li>
				<li>We shall each be considered an independent data controller in
					relation
					to the client personal data. Each of us will comply with all requirements and obligations applicable to us
					under
					the data protection legislation in respect of the client personal data.</li>
				<li>You shall only disclose client personal data to us where:
					<ol>
						<li>you have provided the necessary information to the relevant data
							subjects regarding its use (and you may use or refer to our privacy notice for this purpose);</li>
						<li>you have a lawful basis upon which to do so, which, in the absence of
							any other lawful basis, shall be with the relevant data subject&rsquo;s consent; and </li>
						<li>you have complied with the necessary requirements under the data
							protection legislation to enable you to do so.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Should you require any further details regarding our treatment of
					personal data, please contact our Data Protection Manager.</li>
				<li>We shall only process the client personal data:
					<ol>
						<li>in order to provide our services to you and perform any other
							obligations in accordance with our engagement with you;</li>
						<li>in order to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations; and</li>
						<li>where it is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests
							and
							those interests are not overridden by the data subjects&rsquo; own privacy rights. Our privacy notice contains
							further details as to how we may process client personal data.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>For the purpose of providing our services to you, we may disclose the
					client personal data to members of our firm&rsquo;s network, our regulatory bodies or other third parties (for
					example, our professional advisors or service providers). The third parties to whom we disclose such personal
					data may be located outside of the United Kingdom. We will only disclose client personal data to a third party
					(including a third party outside of the UK) provided that the transfer is undertaken in compliance with the
					data
					protection legislation.</li>
				<li>We shall maintain commercially reasonable and appropriate security
					measures, including administrative, physical and technical safeguards, to protect against unauthorised or
					unlawful processing of the client personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to,
					the
					client personal data.</li>
				<li>In respect of the client personal data, provided that we are legally
					permitted to do so, we shall promptly notify you in the event that:
					<ol>
					<li>we receive a request, from or on
						behalf of a relevant data subject, to exercise their data subject rights under the data protection legislation
						or
						a complaint or any adverse correspondence in respect of our processing of their personal data;</li>
					<li> we are served with an information,
						enforcement or assessment notice (or any similar notices), or receive any other material communication in
						respect
						of our processing of the client personal data from the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office or any other
						supervisory authority; or</li>
					<li>we reasonably believe that there
						has
						been any incident which resulted in the accidental or unauthorised access to, or destruction, loss, unauthorised
						disclosure or alteration of, the client personal data.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Upon the reasonable request of the other, we shall each co-operate
					with
					the other and take such reasonable commercial steps or provide such information as is necessary to enable each
					of us to comply with the data protection legislation in respect of the services provided to you in accordance
					with our engagement letter with you in relation to those services.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Disengagement</li>
			<ol>
				<li>If we resign, or are asked to resign, we will normally issue a
					disengagement letter to ensure that our respective responsibilities are clear. If we have no contact with you
					for a period of 12 months or more, we may issue to your last known address a disengagement letter and
					thereafter
					cease to act.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Electronic and other communication</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Unless you instruct us otherwise, we may, if appropriate, communicate
					with you and with third parties by email or other electronic means. The recipient is responsible for virus
					checking emails and any attachments.</li>
				<li>With electronic communication, there is a risk of non-receipt,
					delayed
					receipt, inadvertent misdirection or interception by third parties. We use virus-scanning software to reduce
					the
					risk of viruses and similar damaging items being transmitted in emails or by electronic storage devices.
					Nevertheless, electronic communication is not totally secure and we cannot be held responsible for damage or
					loss caused by viruses or for communications which are corrupted or altered after despatch. Nor can we accept
					any liability for problems or accidental errors relating to this means of communication, especially in
					relation
					to commercially sensitive material. These are risks you must bear in return for greater efficiency and lower
					costs. If you do not wish to accept these risks, please let us know and we will communicate by paper mail,
					other
					than when electronic submission is mandatory.</li>
				<li>Any communication by us with you sent through the postal system is
					deemed to arrive at your postal address two working days after the day the document was sent.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Fees and payment terms</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Our fees may depend, not only upon the time spent on your affairs,
					but
					also on the level of skill and responsibility and the importance and value of the advice we provide, as well
					as
					the level of risk.</li>
				<li>If we provide you with an estimate of our fees for any specific work,
					the estimate will not be contractually binding unless we explicitly state that will be the case. Otherwise,
					our
					fees will be calculated on the basis of the hours worked by each member of staff necessarily engaged on your
					affairs, multiplied by their charge-out rate per hour, VAT being charged thereon. Indicative hourly charge-out
					rates are as follows:
					<ol>
						<li>Partner: &pound;250</li>
						<li>Consultant: &pound;100</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>If requested, we may indicate a fixed fee for the provision of
					specific
					services or an indicative range of fees for a particular assignment. It is not our practice to identify fixed
					fees for more than a year ahead as such fee quotes need to be reviewed in the light of events. If it becomes
					apparent to us, due to unforeseen circumstances, that a fee quote is inadequate, we reserve the right to
					notify
					you of a revised figure or range and to seek your agreement thereto.</li>
				<li>In some cases, you may be entitled to assistance with your
					professional
					fees, particularly in relation to any investigation into your tax affairs by HMRC. Assistance may be provided
					through insurance policies you hold or via membership of a professional or trade body. Other than where such
					insurance was arranged through us, you will need to advise us of any such insurance cover you have. You will
					remain liable for our fees regardless of whether all or part are liable to be paid by your insurers.
				</li>
				<li>We will bill monthly and our invoices will be due for payment within
					14
					days of issue. Our fees are exclusive of VAT which will be added where it is chargeable. Any disbursements we
					incur on your behalf, and expenses incurred in the course of carrying out our work for you, will be added to
					our
					invoices where appropriate.</li>
				<li>Unless otherwise agreed to the contrary, our fees do not include the
					costs of any third party, counsel or other professional fees. If these costs are incurred to fulfil our
					engagement, such necessary additional charges may be payable by you.</li>
				<li>It is our normal practice to ask clients to pay by monthly direct
					debit
					and periodically to adjust the monthly payment by reference to actual billings.</li>
				<li>We reserve the right to charge interest on late paid invoices at the
					rate of 8% above bank base rates under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998. We also
					reserve
					the right to suspend our services or to cease to act for you, having given written notice, if payment of any
					fees is unduly delayed. We intend to exercise these rights only if it is fair and reasonable to do so.
				</li>
				<li>If you do not accept that an invoiced fee is fair and reasonable, you
					must notify us within 21 days of receipt, failing which, you will be deemed to have accepted that payment is
					due.</li>
				<li>If a client company, trust or other entity is unable or unwilling to
					settle our fees, we reserve the right to seek payment from the individual (or parent company) giving us
					instructions on behalf of the client, and we shall be entitled to enforce any sums due against the group
					company
					or individual nominated to act for you.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Help us to give you the best service</li>
			<ol>
				<li>We are committed to providing you with a high-quality service that is
					both efficient and effective. If, at any point you would like to discuss with us how our service to you could
					be
					improved, or if you are dissatisfied with the service you are receiving, please let us know by contacting us.
				</li>
				<li>We will consider carefully any complaint you may make about our
					service
					as soon as we receive it and do all we can to explain the position to you. We will acknowledge your letter
					within five business days of its receipt and endeavour to deal with your complaint within eight weeks.
				</li>
				<li>If we do not answer your complaint to your satisfaction, you may, of
					course, take up the matter with our professional body, ICAEW.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Intellectual property rights and use of our name</li>
			<ol>
				<li>We will retain all intellectual property rights in any document
					prepared by us during the course of carrying out the engagement except where the law specifically states
					otherwise.</li>
				<li>You are not permitted to use our name in any statement or document
					you
					may issue unless our prior written consent has been obtained. The only exception to this restriction would be
					statements or documents that, in accordance with applicable law, are to be made public.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Interpretation</li>
			<ol>
				<li>If any provision of our engagement letter or terms of business is
					held
					to be void, that provision will be deemed not to form part of this contract. In the event of any conflict
					between these terms of business and the engagement letter or appendices, the relevant provision in the
					engagement letter or schedules will take precedence.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Internal disputes within a client</li>
			<ol>
				<li>If we become aware of a dispute between the parties who own the
					business or who are in some way involved in its ownership and management, it should be noted that our client
					is
					the business and we would not provide information or services to one party without the express knowledge and
					permission of all parties. Unless otherwise agreed by all parties, we will continue to supply information to
					the
					registered office for the attention of the directors/partners/trustees. If conflicting advice, information or
					instructions are received from different directors/partners/trustees in the business, we will refer the matter
					back to the board of directors/the partnership and take no further action until the board/partnership has
					agreed
					the action to be taken.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Investment advice (including insurance distribution services)
			</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Investment business is regulated by the Financial Services and
					Markets
					Act 2000. If, during the provision of professional services to you, you need advice on investments, including
					insurances, we may have to refer you to someone who is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority or
					licensed
					by a Designated Professional Body, as we are not. </li>
			</ol>
			<li>Lien</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Insofar as we are permitted to so by law or by professional
					guidelines,
					we reserve the right to exercise a lien over all funds, documents and records in our possession relating to
					all
					engagements for you until all outstanding fees and disbursements are paid in full.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Limitation of third party rights</li>
			<ol>
				<li>The advice and information we provide to you as part of our service
					is
					for your sole use, and not for any third party to whom you may communicate it, unless we have expressly agreed
					in the engagement letter that a specified third party may rely on our work. We accept no responsibility to
					third
					parties, including any group company to whom the engagement letter is not addressed, for any advice,
					information
					or material produced as part of our work for you which you make available to them. A party to this agreement
					is
					the only person who has the right to enforce any of its terms, and no rights or benefits are conferred on any
					third party under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Period of engagement and termination </li>
			<ol>
				<li>Unless otherwise agreed in our engagement letter, our work will begin
					when we receive implicit or explicit acceptance of that letter. Except as stated in that letter, we will not
					be
					responsible for periods before that date.</li>
				<li>Each of us may terminate our agreement by giving not less than 21
					days&rsquo; notice in writing to the other party except if you fail to cooperate with us or we have reason to
					believe that you have provided us or HMRC with misleading information, in which case we may terminate this
					agreement immediately. Termination will be without prejudice to any rights that may have accrued to either of
					us
					before termination.</li>
				<li>We reserve the right to terminate the engagement between us with
					immediate effect in the event of: your insolvency, bankruptcy or other arrangement being reached with
					creditors;
					an independence issue or change in the law which means we can no longer act; failure to pay our fees by the
					due
					dates; or either party being in breach of their obligations if this is not corrected within 30 days of being
					asked to do so.</li>
				<li>In the event of termination of our contract, we will endeavour to
					agree
					with you the arrangements for the completion of work in progress at that time, unless we are required for
					legal
					or regulatory reasons to cease work immediately. In that event, we will not be required to carry out further
					work and shall not be responsible or liable for any consequences arising from termination.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Professional rules and statutory obligations</li>
			<ol>
				<li>We will observe and act in accordance with the Bye-laws, regulations
					and Code of Ethics of ICAEW including Professional Conduct in Relation to Taxation and will accept
					instructions
					to act for you on this basis. In particular, you give us the authority to correct errors made by HMRC if we
					become aware of them. We will not be liable for any loss, damage or cost arising from our compliance with
					statutory or regulatory obligations. You can see copies of these requirements in our offices. The requirements
					are also available online at <a
						href="http://www.icaew.com/en/membership/regulations-standards-and-guidance">icaew.com/en/membership/regulations-standards-and-guidance</a>.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Quality control</li>
			<ol>
				<li>As part of our ongoing commitment to provide a quality service, our
					files are periodically reviewed by an independent regulatory or quality control body. These reviewers are
					highly
					experienced professionals and are bound by the same rules of confidentiality as our principals.</li>
				<li>When dealing with HMRC on your behalf we are required to be honest
					and
					to take reasonable care to ensure that your returns are correct. To enable us to do this, you are required to
					be
					honest with us and to provide us with all necessary information in a timely manner. For more information about
					&lsquo;Your Charter&rsquo; for your dealings with HMRC, visit <a
						href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-charter">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-charter</a>.
					To the best of our abilities, we will ensure that HMRC meet their side of the Charter in their
					dealings with you.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Reliance on advice</li>
			<ol>
				<li>We will endeavour to record all advice on important matters in
					writing.
					Advice given orally is not intended to be relied upon unless confirmed in writing. Therefore, if we provide
					oral
					advice (for example, during the course of a meeting or a telephone conversation) and you wish to be able to
					rely
					on that advice, you must ask for the advice to be confirmed by us in writing. Advice is valid as at the date
					it
					was given.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Retention of papers</li>
			<ol>
				<li>You have a legal responsibility to retain documents and records
					relevant to your financial affairs. During the course of our work we may collect information from you and
					others
					relevant to your tax and financial affairs. We will return any original documents to you. Documents and
					records
					relevant to your tax affairs are required by law to be retained as follows:</li>
				<li>Individuals, trustees and partnerships:
					<ol>
						<li>with trading or rental income: five years and 10 months after the end
							of the tax year</li>
						<li>otherwise: 22 months after the end of the tax year.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Companies, Limited Liability Partnerships, and other corporate entities:
					<ol>
						<li>six years from the end of the accounting period.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Although certain documents may legally belong to you, we may destroy
					correspondence and other papers that we store electronically or otherwise that are more than seven years old,
					except documents we think may be of continuing significance. You must tell us if you wish us to keep any
					document for any longer period. </li>
			</ol>
			<li>The Provision of Services Regulations 2009</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Our professional indemnity insurer is Marsh Commercial, of
					Castlemead,
					Lower Castle Street, Bristol, BS1 3AG. The territorial coverage is worldwide, excluding professional business
					carried out from an office in the United States of America or Canada, and excludes any action for a claim
					brought in any court in the United States or Canada.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Timing of our services </li>
			<ol>
				<li>If you provide us with all information and explanations on a timely
					basis in accordance with our requirements, we will plan to undertake the work within a reasonable period of
					time
					to meet any regulatory deadlines. However, failure to complete our services before any such regulatory
					deadline
					would not, of itself, mean that we are liable for any penalty or additional costs arising.</li>
			</ol>
		</ol>

				<h2 style="display:inline">RIGHTS OF ACCESS, CORRECTION, ERASURE, AND RESTRICTION</h2>
				<h3>Your duty to inform us of changes</h3>
				<p>It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current.
					Should your personal information change, please notify us of any changes of which we need to be made aware by
					contacting us, using the contact details below. </p>
				<h3>Your rights in connection with personal data</h3>
				<p>Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Request access to your personal data. This enables you to receive
						details of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are processing it lawfully.</li>
					<li>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.

					</li>
					<li>Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to
						delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have
						the
						right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have exercised your right to object to
						processing (see below).</li>
					<li>Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a
						legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which
						makes you want to object to processing on this basis. You also have the right to object where we are
						processing
						your personal information for direct marketing purposes. </li>
					<li>Request the restriction of processing of your personal data. This
						enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal data about you, for example if you want us to
						establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</li>
					<li>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or another data
						controller if the processing is based on consent, carried out by automated means and this is technically
						feasible.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>If you want to exercise any of the above rights, please email our Data Protection
					Point
					of Contact info@cedarbloomaccounting.co.uk.</p>
				<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of
					the
					other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee for the administrative costs of complying with the
					request
					if your request for access is manifestly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with
					the
					request in such circumstances.</p>

				<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity
					and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another
					appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no
					right
					to receive it.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2 style="display:inline">RIGHT TO WITHDRAW CONSENT</h2>
				<p>In the limited circumstances where you may have provided your consent to the
					collection, processing and transfer of your personal data for a specific purpose (for example, in relation to
					direct marketing that you have indicated you would like to receive from us), you have the right to withdraw
					your
					consent for that specific processing at any time. To withdraw your consent, please email our Data Protection
					Point
					of Contact info@cedarbloomaccounting.co.uk.</p>
				<p>Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no
					longer process your personal information (personal data) for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to,
					unless we have another legitimate basis for doing so in law.</p>
